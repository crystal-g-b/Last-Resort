#  Last Resort  

## Project Name - Last Resort 

### User Story - 
I am looking to enjoy something that I have at home either with a date or by myself. I need recommendations and I am too lazy/panicked to figure out what to do. I am going to use Last Resort to help set the mood with either a movie or some music with a fun drink!

### Description of the App - 
After a year of Covid, are you having problems with your social skills? You’re certainly not alone! Studies have shown that many people are unable to socialize properly as a result of Covid. This app will help take some of the stress away from setting the right atmosphere! Now you can work on becoming the social person you once were! Unlike other apps, which just provide you with drinks or a date. It will provide you with the perfect drink so you don’t have to spend any extra time stressing about it. It will also provide a recommendation to you with a song or movie of your choice. We know how hard it can be to make up your mind after a hard week at work. All you want to do is relax and hang out. Don’t worry, we got you covered!


### Build Status 
The app is at the MVP stage, where the basic funtionality of the app is completed.

### Future Ideas 
Applying the APIs to different pages so people could type in the genre or a liquor that they wanted to listen to or drink a list of items would come up as suggestions for the person to select from. The pages are created and sitting in the folder for the app however in the interest of time the ideas were put into WIP.
